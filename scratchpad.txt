we are going to write a new function

Write-Modeldef

this will be appending text to the file in that path stored in: $script:gzdsu_auto_modeldefs_path

$script:RandomSpriteName will have its last two characters trimmed before being appended

write this block of text to the new file (retaining quotes as displayed) (with a linebreak before and after)

Model $script:UserDefinedActorName {
    Path "models/models_auto"
    Model 0 "$script:model_for_import"
    Skin 0 "$script:randomly_generated_texture_name"
    Scale 1.0 1.0 1.0
    FrameIndex $script:RandomSpriteName A 0 0
}
